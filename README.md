## Purpose

The **AMBOT (Adaptive Machine Bot for Operations and Tasks) Project** aims to develop an advanced autonomous prototype robot capable of performing a wide range of operational tasks and adaptive exploratory functions.  
Key features and objectives include:

- **Intelligent navigation** and interaction within dynamic environments.
- **Autonomous detection, analysis, and manipulation** of various objects based on mission objectives.
- **Voice-command capabilities**: AMBOT can receive and execute spoken instructions.
- **Manual control**: Operators may issue commands via a laptop interface (through APC radio modules), allowing seamless transition between autonomy and direct human control.
- **Versatility** for applications such as exploration (planetary rover analog), environmental monitoring, object retrieval, and emergency response.

This project demonstrates innovative robotics technology intended to enhance operational efficiency, adaptability, and effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios.

## Features & Technical Details

- **Computer Vision**: ESP32-CAM with image recognition algorithms for object identification and classification.
- **Proximity & Obstacle Sensing**: LiDAR sensor enables robust obstacle detection and path planning.
- **Robotic Arm**: Mechanical arm powered by high-torque and 9G servos for dexterous object manipulation.
- **Orientation & Stability**: BNO085 9DoF sensor provides real-time orientation and balance data.
- **Real-Time Location Tracking**: Neo-6M GPS module delivers continuous and accurate geolocation data.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: MS5611 sensor for high-precision altitude and atmospheric pressure readings.
- **Wireless Communication**: APC220 radio modules for stable, long-range communication with external controllers.
- **Audio Interaction**: Microphone and speaker enable bidirectional voice interaction.
- **Motor & Motion Control**: 520 series DC motors and driver for agile and efficient mobility.
- **Power Management**: Dual/redundant LiPo battery configuration; selectable power distribution modes: Left, Both, Right.
- **Connectors & Interfaces**: JST XH connectors and header pins for secure, modular electrical connections.
